# How to run the code
To run the AES Implementation, do the following steps:
- Ensure Python is installed in your system.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run the code in the terminal,
- If on command prompt navigate to the directory containing AES.py, run the code by typing "python AES.py"
The code will execute the encryption and decryption process displaying the results in the console.

# Statement-1
This script represents a comprehensive effort to ensure accuracy and functionality according to the NIST standards for AES encryption and decryption processes. The NIST file helped me understand the process of encryption and decryption and for my further understanding I watched many videos on Youtube which made it visually easy. Just to familiarize myself with XOR operations in code I had to a little research on the internet with examples.

# Statement-2
It's been a challenge to adapt the script for precise output matching. Hence, matching all the test cases in appendix C. Also, please note the output will display all 3 Encryption first and then all 3 decryption.
